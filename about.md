## About Jessica

Welcome to my website. It mainly exists because I didn't want any other Jessica Dussaults out there to get the domain and put something I don't like on it.

When I was a kid I had big plans. When I grew up I was going to:

- be a professional soccer player
- play cello with the Boston Pops
- perform for Yo-Yo Ma
- run a large animal vet clinic
- be a famous novelist

I have only accomplished one of those goals so far, but that's okay; I have done lots of other cool things, instead.

After getting sidetracked from music performance by a career in digital humanities, I now find myself working as a programmer in civic tech. Before this, I worked for 7 years in the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities where I got to put together super cool projects with great people.

Meanwhile, I am also fortunately enough to get to play a lot of music! I am a member of Lincoln's Symphony Orchestra and also play with Abendmusik, David von Kampen, Andrea von Kampen, the occasional touring artist, and one-offs around town.
