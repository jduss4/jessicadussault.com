## About Jessica

Welcome to my website. It exists because I didn't want any other Jessica Dussaults out there to get the domain and put something I don't like on it. There are some Jessica Dussaults in the world who probably don't like what I've put on it, but I guess that's life.

I guess I should introduce myself. My name is Jessica. I sometimes make terrible websites for myself. I try to make better websites for other people. This feels strange to me, because websites were not on my list in 6th grade when I decided on my life goals:

- be a professional soccer player
- play cello with the Boston Pops
- perform for Yo-Yo Ma
- play at Carnegie Hall
- run a large animal vet clinic
- be a famous novelist

2 down, 4 to go.
